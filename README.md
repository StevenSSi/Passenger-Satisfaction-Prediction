# Passenger-Satisfaction-Prediction

## Summary
This is a MIT hackathon competition at the end of its Applied Data Science Program. The goal of the problem is to predict whether a passenger was satisfied or not considering his/her overall experience of traveling on the Shinkansen Bullet Train.

## Usage
- Pre-processing.ipynb: contains all the Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Scaling, Missing Value Imputation, Batch Normalization and Univariate & Bivariate Data Visualization.

- ML_models.ipynb: contains three machine learning models for a binary classification task of predicting whether a customer is satisfied with his/her trip or not given demographical and survery information. At the end of the notebook, an ensemble learning technique is used using majority voting to create the most accurate predictions.

## Outcome
The prediction on the designated testing dataset was submitted to the hackathon host and received a accuracy of 0.9569406, ranking 2 out of 108 participants.
